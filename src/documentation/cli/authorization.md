# Authorization

## Login Using Personal Token

If you are using zcli outside of your computer, as in a [GitHub Action](/documentation/deploy/use-in-github-actions.html) or a [GitLab Job](/documentation/deploy/use-in-gitlab-ci.html) you might want to use a **personal token** to [`log in`](/documentation/cli/installation-authorization.html#login-using-personal-token). These can be created by clicking on your avatar in the right upper corner and going to the Token management page.

After you create your personal token, you can log in using

```bash
$ zcli login --zeropsToken=<personal token>
```

or better yet by adding `ZEROPSTOKEN` to your enviroment variables, in which case the token doesn't need to be passed as a parameter. *This is hte preferred* and more secure option, as the token doesn't show up in logs this way.

```bash
$ zcli login
```

## Login Using E-mail and Password

You can also log in using your email and password.

```bash
$ zcli login --zeropsLogin=<email> --zeropsPassword=<password>
```

or by adding `ZEROPSLOGIN` and `ZEROPSPASSWORD` to your environment variables.

::: tip LOG IN ONLY ONCE
You need to log in only once. Auth token will be saved securely in your `var` folder inside your filesystem.
