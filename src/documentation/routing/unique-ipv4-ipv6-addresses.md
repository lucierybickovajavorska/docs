# IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses in Zerops

Each [project]() you create gets assigned a **unique IPv6 address**. This can be used to set up [direct access]() (optionally protected by a firewall) to any of the project's [services](), or to be set as your **AAAA record** and set up [domain access]().

As IPv6 is not widely used, you can activate a **unique IPv4 address** for your project. This is useful for production projects, as this address can be used as your **A record**. A unique IPv4 address costs [$5 per month per project]().

If you need to access your dev / stage / preview projects, you should use a [Zerops subdomain]().
