# Using Your Domain to Access a Service

You can easily set up routing rules â€” which domains and their locations should point to which service inside of your [project](/documentation/overview/projects-and-services-structure.html#project).

All you need to do is point your domains A and / or AAAA records to one of the [unique IP addresses](/documentation/routing/unique-ipv4-ipv6-addresses.html) assigned to your [project](/documentation/overview/projects-and-services-structure.html#project).

**[Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL Certificate can be automatically installed for you.**

**Domain access can be enabled only on services running on an HTTP protocol**. Internally, Zerops points all traffic to an L7 HTTP Balancer that takes care of SSL certificate installation and load balancing traffic to selected container running your app.
