# Runtime Logs

Each container your [service](/documentation/overview/projects-and-services-structure.html#service) is running on gets its own runtime log. You can view each one inside the **Runtime log** tab of your service detail.

Whenever an important event happens, such as an exit or a failure, you will get a notification with a button pointing to the particular container and to the relevant timestamp.
