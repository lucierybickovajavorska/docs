# Made for Developers

From the very beginning, our goal was to make DevOps as easy and straightforward for the developers as possible. It's great when you can move your infrastructure to a cloud, but not so great when you need to hire _that cloud app_ certified engineer to set everything up properly. And wait forever while he does so. Not even mentioning the invoice they'll inevitably send.

We took our 14 years of [experience](https://vshosting.eu/about) providing managed cloud solutions for developers and turned it into Zerops. Not only do we aim to make Zerops a great solution for production, but also a helpful tool for local development. As such, we [encourage](/documentation/overview/made-for-developers.html#each-developer-should-have-his-own-account-no-artificial-pricing-boosting) for each environment and for each team member to have their own copy of infrastructure. On Zerops, there is no limit for the number of team members or projects you can add. On top of that, each service is free on the basic level.

### Each developer should have his own account, no artificial pricing boosting

To be able to fully utilize Zerops, each developer should have his own account and if it makes sense for the project, even his own copy of the project. That's why we don't charge extra or put limits on the number of projects or number of team members. You only pay for the performance and add-ons.

### Empower you local development

Using our [zcli](/documentation/cli/installation-authorization.html#installation), you can securely connect to your project using a built in [VPN](/documentation/cli/vpn.html). This means you can locally connect to a database running on Zerops, so you don't need to have it running locally. Each developer can have their own copy of the project. This can also be used to securely import data to a database - any service running inside the project will instantaneously become securely available on your computer.

### Always open to new ideas
