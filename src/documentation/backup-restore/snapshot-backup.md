# Snapshot Backup / Restore

::: danger CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE
Snapshot backup will be implemented at the Release candidate stage. See [roadmap]().
:::

Zerops will be taking daily snapshots of the entire infrastructure of each project, including its data, allowing you to restore the entire project as it was at a predetermined point in time.

This will be done automatically. Add-on to keep snapshots longer or take snapshots more often can be activated for each project.

Snapshots are saved to a geographically separate location.
